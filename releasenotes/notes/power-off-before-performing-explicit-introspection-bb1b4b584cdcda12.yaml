    Fixes an issue where re-inspection from failed prior introspection
    attempts that failed due to unrelated reasons, such as networking
    failures, may fail if inspection is requested is requested while
    the machine is still powered-on. This is as some hardware will not
    accept new boot device commands in the Power-On-Self-Test state,
    which is a state a machine which had a failure in networking may be
    in. Inspector now powers off the node before performing inspection
    when it is managing the inspection process.
